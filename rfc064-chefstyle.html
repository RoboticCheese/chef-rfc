<h1>Chef code should have a consistent style</h1>

<p>There is a high cognitive load involved in switching between projects
that have different or inconsistent code styles that impacts developer
productivity and happiness. Chef should produce a consistent code style
for its open source ruby code and apply it.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a developer,
I want to be productive quickly in all Chef&#39;s projects,
so that I can concentrate on writing code.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>https://github.com/chef/chefstyle provides a rubocop configuration that
is intended to be applied to chef/chef and related projects, such as
chef/ohai, and chef/mixlib-*. The community should arrive, via
pull requests to <code>chefstyle</code>, at a set of style checks that can be
enforced (via travis, etc) on chef community maintained ruby projects.</p>

<p>Chefstyle, by default, disables all rubocop cops, providing a clean
sheet for us to build upon. PRs to enable rules should be accompanied
with a PR to chef/chef demonstrating the feasibility of enabling the
rule and to allow discussion of actual changes.</p>

<p>This style checker is not intended for use with cookbooks, which have
different requirements.</p>
