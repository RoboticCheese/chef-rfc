<h1>Server HTTP HEAD</h1>

<p>There is a greater resource cost than is necessary when querying the Server
API named object endpoints for the existence of a single object. Currently, if
checking for an object&#39;s existence, only HTTP <code>GET</code> requests are supported by
the server. This means the entire object is fetched, consuming resources
across the server, network and client. When viewed from a large scale
perspective, this overhead can cause slow downs that can have compounding
effects.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Chef developer, 

I want to be able to write code that queries the
Server for the existence of a single object via a light-weight API call
and response, 

so that my applications can run as efficiently and as
quickly as possible.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The HEAD method shall be identical to GET except that the server must not
return a message-body in the response.</p>

<p>The meta-information contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD
request should be identical to the information sent in response to a GET
request.</p>

<p>The HEAD HTTP verb will be added to oc_erchef and chef-zero named object
endpoints such that a client http HEAD request for an object name will result
in the following standard http response codes (no different than a <code>GET</code>):</p>

<p>Code | Reason
--- | ---
200 | object exists
401 | request signature is invalid
403 | requestor does not have READ on the object
404 | object does not exist</p>

<p>example named endpoint: /nodes/NAME</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>In addition to <code>chef-server</code>, <code>chef-zero</code> will need this capability added so
that it remains in lock-step.</p>

<p>As an optimization and/or feature addition, several other downstream items
could benefit including: Chef::ChefFS, Chef::Knife, knife-ec-backup.</p>
