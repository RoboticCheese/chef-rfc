<h1>Remove Unused Cookbook Metadata</h1>

<p>There are a set of metadata fields that have never been really supported
by Chef, and so we should remove them.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a community advocate,
I want to ensure that cookbook maintainers focus on the things that
matter,
so that they can write better cookbooks.

As a chef developer,
I like removing code,
so that there are fewer bugs.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Mark as deprecated and subsequently remove the <code>recommends</code>, <code>suggests</code>,
<code>conflicts</code>, <code>replaces</code> and <code>grouping</code> metadata fields.</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Chef Server should be updated to not serve this metadata, docs need to
be updated. Also, generators such as <code>chef generate</code>, <code>berks cookbook</code>
need to be updated to ensure they do not create metadata files with
those fields.</p>
