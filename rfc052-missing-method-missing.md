# Remove magic and method_missing from Chef::Resource lookup

This proposal:

- Switches to explicit methods for Chef recipe DSL instead of method_missing
- Removes all special treatment of classes in the Chef::Resource and Chef::Provider namespaces
- Automatically adds resource DSL for all named descendants of Chef::Resource, no matter what their namespace

## Compatibility

In Chef 12, three behavior changes will be noted:

- Stack traces for resource declarations will usually no longer contain
  `method_missing` (and will instead contain the name of the resources).
- Classes outside of the Chef::Resource namespace will now be placed in recipe
  DSL automatically.
- Warnings are issued for deprecated behavior that will change in Chef 13 (see
  Deprecations section).

In Chef 13, deprecated behavior will be removed (along with method_missing).  All
of these have deprecation warnings enabled for Chef 12 (see Deprecations section).

## Motivation

    As a Chef user,
    I want resources declared in my own namespace to be in recipe DSL automatically,
    so that I don't have to write the name of the resource twice.

    As a Chef user,
    I want to declare resources in my own namespace,
    So that I get better error messages when there is a resource conflict.

    As a Chef developer,
    I want meaningful names in stack traces for methods,
    So that I can actually read the debug output.

    As a Chef developer,
    I want less if statements, case statements and metaprogramming in DSL method calls,
    So that I can debug and follow logic more easily.

## Specification

### Create explicit DSL methods for resources

When looking up resources, there is no method anywhere that corresponds to the
actual resource name.  This can lead to a lot of unnecessarily heavy thinking
when following some very typical stack traces.  It also means that the name of
the resource being declared is often not on the stack, making debugging harder.

Here we propose that all resource and definition DSL be added to
`Chef::DSL::Recipe` as actual methods, as they are created, so that they can be
subject to inspection and the stack traces can be followed.  This will happen
automatically when the user declares resources and definitions.

### Stop automatically adding resources to recipe DSL

Presently, when you create a class under `Chef::Resource`, a magical Chef DSL
based on the class name (`my_resource`) will automatically work.  Now you will
need to use `provides` to explicitly mark the DSL you provide:

```ruby
class MyPackage::MyResource < Chef::Resource
  provides :shazam
end
# Now `shazam` will work fine in a recipe, but `my_resource` will not.
```

We will ensure that all existing core Chef classes in the `chef`, `cheffish`,
and `chef-provisioning*` gems use `provides` to avoid warnings.  LWRPs will
automatically do this as well.

### Remove the `dsl_name` and `resource_name` class methods

When resource DSL becomes explicit, the idea that a class has a single DSL name
no longer makes sense.  We will remove `self.dsl_name` from `Resource` and `self.resource_name` from `Chef::Resource::LWRPBase`.

### Move LWRPs out of the Chef::Resource namespace

With Chef::Resource no longer a special place for class lookup, LWRPs no longer
need to be given a namespace.  We will now make resources/x.rb and providers/x.rb
an anonymous class, with string methods to make it easy to see where they come
from.  This avoids a number of potential errors and warnings that can happen in
the case of conflicts, and gives us control over how we handle conflicts.

Users who wish to set the class of the resource can assign it directly in the
LWRP with `Namespace::MyResource = self`.

## Deprecations and Errors

Removing `method_missing` means several methods of creating resource names cannot
be caught.  These are the cases.  We will issue deprecation warnings for each one
and remove them (and method_missing) come Chef 13.

### Chef::Resource::MyResource without `provides`

When you have a class in the `Chef::Resource` namespace without `provides`, the
DSL will no longer work in Chef 13.  In 12 we will issue a deprecation warning
whenever the user tries to use a DSL class without corresponding DSL.

There is a backwards compatibility break related to moving a `Chef::Resource`
class from not having `provides`, to having `provides`.  Specifically, in Chef 12
we don't check for `Chef::Resource::FooBar` until after we have asked all
resources if `provides?` is true.  This gave `provides` classes an implicit
*priority* over non-provides `Chef::Resource` classes.

If someone is (knowingly or unknowingly) taking advantage of this implicit
priority, and adds `provides :foo_bar` to `Chef::Resource::FooBar`, it would be
considered (and possibly selected) along with other classes that say things like
`provides :foo_bar, os: 'linux'`.  If there are multiple matches, we pick the
first class alphabetically.  This would change behavior.

The correct workaround for the user in this case is to use
`Chef.set_resource_priority_array :foo_bar [Linux::FooBar, Chef::Resource::FooBar]`, which will bring the correct version into ascendancy
again.

### Calling `method_missing` directly

If people call `method_missing` directly to invoke DSL methods, and we don't
define it anymore, it obviously won't actually invoke the methods.  We will
detect this in method_missing, issue a warning telling people to call the
actual method instead or use public_send(), and remove it come Chef 13.

### Custom `provides?` without corresponding `provides :name`

If someone creates a resource class with a custom `provides?` method, they can
currently

```ruby
class MyResource < Chef::Resource
  def provides?(node, name)
    name == :blah
  end
end
```

The implications of this are that we have to scan every single resource when
you type `blah` in a recipe, just so we can catch this one.  In Chef 12 we will
issue a deprecation warning and tell you to do this instead:

```ruby
class MyResource < Chef::Resource
  provides :blah
end
```

### Referencing Chef::Resource::MyLWRPResource

When you create an LWRP, it is presently placed in
`Chef::Resource::CookbooknameResourcename`.  In the spirit of not placing user
defined stuff into the core Chef namespace, this will no longer happen.  Any
user that calls `Chef::Resource::MyLwrpResource.new` or extends directly from
the name `Chef::Resource::MyLwrpResource` will receive a warning.

## Risks To Specific Software

While we're trying to maintain full compatibility, there's risk here, particularly for people doing metaprogramming of resources.  We will run the tests of the following packages, and make sure current versions still work (possibly emitting
deprecation warnings):

- chef-sugar
- chefspec
- chef-rewind
- Poise
- Crazytown
- Halite
- foodcritic
