# Chef Maintainer Council

To ensure the Chef community gets the best possible voice and
representation, we would like to create a formal process for the
maintainers of Chef to get together, discuss issues, and provide
recommendations to both the wider Chef community and also to Chef
Software.

Having a council made up of Project Maintainers provides a direct link to the
people most involved in Chef's evolution and development.

## Definitions

<dl>
<dt>Lieutenant</dt><dd>Means someone who (a) is willing to perform the duties of a Lieutenant; (b) receives an absolute majority of affirmative votes of existing Lieutenants; and (c) is approved as a Lieutenant by the Project Lead.</dd>

<dt>Project Maintainers</dt><dd>means the current list of maintainers, lieutenants, and project lead as defined in the Maintenance Policy.</dd>

<dt>Project Lead</dt><dd>means a leader in the Chef Community.  The initial Project Lead is Adam Jacob.</dd>

<dt>User/Contributor</dt><dd> Means (a) an organization that uses Chef and that has published at least one use case; and/or (b) an individual contributor to the Project who is not a Company employee.</dd>
</dl>

## Open participation

Throughout the project:  anyone should be able to participate and contribute. All bugs and tasks will be tracked in a public tracker and all of the source code and all of the tools needed to build it will be available under an open license permitting unrestricted use

Open technical value: technical value over pride of authorship. Code is contributed for the express purpose of advancing technologies relevant to the project, effectively separating technology advancement from individual or commercial intent.

Open design: Roadmaps are discussed in the open, and design receives input from all contributors and maintainers

Influence through contribution: organizations and individuals gain influence over the project through contribution.

IP Cleanliness: Steps are taken to ensure that all incoming code is legally contributed (CLAs, terms-of-use, etc.), that use of approved third party libraries does not create incompatible dependencies

Open Licensing: code should be licensed using approved, standard, open-source licenses. (Chef is currently licensed under Apache 2.0).

## Specification

Once a year, at a Community Summit or ChefConf, Chef Software will
provide meeting space and AV to allow all the maintainers of Chef to meet, discuss
concerns, share ideas and ensure that our communities are healthy and
moving in appropriate directions.

The Maintainers Council does not change the existing decision making
processes of the project, in particular the RFC process defined in
RFC000 and RFC001. 

## Grievance Handling

When a member has a concern about the Chef Project, the member may raise
that concern with a maintainer or a community advocate. If the member is
not satisfied with the result, the member can raise the concern directly
with the Project Lead.

## Downstream Impact

This supersedes the Chef Board of Governance. The CBGB will be
terminated, as per RFC29.
