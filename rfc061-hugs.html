<h1>Hugging in the Chef Community</h1>

<p>In order to bridge the cultural gap between the US and Worldwide community the
concept of hugging should be explained.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Chef Community Participant,
I want to express positive emotion to or for another Chef Community Participant,
so that we can express our friendship physically.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Foremost, we want all community members to feel safe and welcome. This is
expressed in the Chef Community Guidelines (<a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc020-community-guidelines.md">RFC020</a>) and the Code of
Conduct for our events (e.g. <a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/chefconfcodeofconduct/">ChefConf</a>). When approaching another
Chef Community Member that you wish to engage in a hug, you must first seek
permission from the other community member by either verbally or physically
indicating that you wish to hug them.</p>

<p>An example, but not limited to, of a verbal indication for permission to hug is
to ask &quot;Can I give you a hug?&quot; or &quot;Can we hug?&quot; The other party should then
respond with verbal statement; for example &quot;Yes, we can&quot; or &quot;Yes, you may.&quot;
is a positive reaction, whereas &quot;No, Thank you.&quot; or &quot;No, thanks&quot; are considered
negative reactions.</p>

<p>An example, but not limited to, of a physical indication for permission to hug
is spread your arms apart from your body. The other party can indicate
permission by repeating the same physical expression to provide consent.</p>

<p>If Community member would like to express a hug, but has a limitation via
a sickness or unable to use the typical hug process they may also express via
other means, examples are but not limited to:
- fist bumps
- high fives
- in the case of an illness
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_bump">elbow to elbow</a>
  - backward head nods by moving the chin upwards</p>

<p>A Community member may signal their desire not to participate in the hug.
Such signals may include, but are not limited to:
- walking away
- shaking ones head in a sign of &quot;No&quot;
- verbally expressing &quot;No, Thank you.&quot;
- crossing your arms over your chest placing your right hand on your left
  shoulder and left hand on your right shoulder</p>
