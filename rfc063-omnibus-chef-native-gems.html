<h1>Omnibus Chef Native Gem Additions</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Chef User,
I want to have omnibus-chef ship with nokogiri,
Because that will speed up my initial converges, and ease my pain at installing it.

As a Chef User,
I want to have omnibus-chef ship with popular Open Source databases,
Because that will speed up my initial converges, and again ease my pain.

As a Postgres Cookbook Author,
I need a better way to install native gems, as the required workarounds use unstable Ruby APIs and links to the omnibus packaged OpenSSL library, which makes the cookbook very complex and brittle.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The supporting native libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>libxml2</li>
<li>libxslt</li>
<li>libpq</li>

<p>And the following gems:</p>

<ul>
<li>nokogiri</li>
<li>pg</li>
<li>mysql2</li>
</ul>

<p>Will be added to the omnibus-chef distribution on all Tier #1 systems.</p>
