<h1>Local Mode Default</h1>

<p>Turn on Local Mode by default in Chef 12 (do not require -z).</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a new Chef user,
I want to be able to run my first recipe without typing weird parameters,
so that I can come to love Chef that much more quickly and without any conceptual obstacles.

As a local developer,
I want to be able to iterate quickly on recipes with less typing,
so that I can avoid carpal tunnel syndrome.

As a Chef book or tutorial author,
I want to be able to write examples free of dashes,
because they mess up formatting and make the user ask questions I don&#39;t need them asking early in the tutorial.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>I propose that:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Chef::Config.local_mode</code> default to <code>true</code> when <code>chef_server_url</code> is not set.</li>
<li>The default <code>Chef::Config.chef_server_url</code> of https://localhost:443 be removed (and have no default).</li>
<li>When <code>chef-client</code> does not find <code>/etc/chef/client.rb</code>, it search for <code>knife.rb</code> in the same manner as local mode.</li>
<li>The warning for missing config file is set to INFO.</li>
<li>When the config file is missing, the algorithm that detects the chef repository by looking for a &quot;cookbooks/&quot; directory also looks for &quot;clients/&quot; (and thus, after the first time you run chef-client, you will no longer get any warnings).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>This will make it so that when you first walk up to Chef, your experience is thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;puts &#39;hi&#39;&quot;</span> &gt; x.rb
$ chef-client x.rb
WARN: No chef repository detected at or above current directory <span class="o">(</span>no cookbooks/ or clients/ subdirectories found<span class="o">)</span>.  Assuming current directory <span class="o">(</span>/Users/jkeiser/test<span class="o">)</span>.
WARN: chef-client will create a /Users/jkeiser/test/clients and /Users/jkeiser/test/nodes, and you will not see this warning again.
...
$ knife node list
foo
$ chef-client x.rb
...
</pre></div>
<p>Presently, when chef-client is run without configuration (or the configuration does not point at a Chef server), we assume the user wanted to point at a local Chef server (https://localhost:443).  This is not a particularly common mode of operation now that chef-zero exists (which only recently supported https), and many many more users will be running local mode.  Further, existing real clients will definitely <em>not</em> be pointing at localhost; they point at real servers.</p>

<p>This change could have been implemented more simply by simply defaulting <code>Chef::Config.local_mode</code> to <code>true</code>.  However, this would impact nearly all chef-clients (which would stop working until local<em>mode was turned off) without actually helping any more of the intended users (who generally will not have configuration).  By tying this to setting the `chef</em>server_url`, we ensure that clients who actually want to contact a Chef server can do so, and target only people who weren&#39;t talking to a Chef server in the first place.</p>

<p>The oddest behavior here is that users who want to run <code>chef-client</code> in local mode on a managed machine probably won&#39;t actually run in local mode.  Without changing the default behavior of <code>chef-client</code>, I&#39;m not sure there is a way around this without changing the config structure completely (which would be another RFC).  Nonetheless, this at least gets us much closer to a parameter-free world, and <em>definitely</em> gets us there for new users.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>chef-client</code> and <code>knife</code>, when run with no parameters and no configuration, will run in local mode without the <code>-z</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Existing clients that <em>do</em> have configuration but assume the Chef server is at https://localhost:443, will start running with empty runlists.</li>
<li>Existing clients that do not have <code>/etc/chef/client.rb</code> but just assume https://localhost:443 will load <code>knife.rb</code>.</li>
<li>Users who want to run <code>chef-client</code> in local mode on a managed machine with <code>/etc/chef/client.rb</code> will not end up loading <code>knife.rb</code> and probably not even run local mode.</li>
<li>When users accidentally run knife and chef-client outside of their repository, they will now warn the user but still give them output which they might not expect.  When you run <code>knife node list</code>, for example, outside of a repository, it will not return any nodes and have empty output.  We rely on the warnings to indicate to the user that something is up:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ knife node list
WARN: No chef repository detected at or above current directory <span class="o">(</span>no cookbooks/ or clients/ subdirectories found<span class="o">)</span>.  Assuming current directory <span class="o">(</span>/Users/jkeiser/test<span class="o">)</span>.
WARN: You may not be in the right directory.
</pre></div>
<p>Before, that would have triggered an error related to not having a private key or being able to access https://localhost:443.</p>
