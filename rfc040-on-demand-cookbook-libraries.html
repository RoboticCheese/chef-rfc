<h1>On-Demand Cookbook Libraries</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a library cookbook writer,
I want to have nested directories,
So that I can organize my code and make it more readable.

As a library cookbook writer,
I want to control the load order of my library,
So that I can have code in one file that refers to code in another file without constraining the filenames.

As a library cookbook writer,
I want to be able to `require` files in my library cookbook,
So that I don&#39;t have to deal with the pitfalls of `require_relative` (particularly that it loads things multiple times).

As a library cookbook user,
I want to be able to `require` files in the library cookbooks I use,
So that I can pick and choose what functionality I want to load.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>When a user creates a cookbook, they can add the following directive to the metadata:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># metadata.rb</span>
<span class="nb">name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;mylibrary&quot;</span>
<span class="n">version</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0.0.1&quot;</span>
<span class="n">eager_load_libraries</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If <code>eager_load_libraries</code> is false, Chef Client would instead append it to the ruby load path.  This would occur in the phase where the <code>libraries</code> files of a cookbook otherwise be automatically required in alphabetical order.  All recipes, libraries, and other Ruby code running in the Chef Client can then use <code>require &#39;filename&#39;</code><code>and it will load</code>cookbooks/mycookbook/libraries/filename` if present.</p>

<p>If <code>eager_load_libraries</code> contains a list of files or globs, the library path is appended to the Ruby load path, and the listed files are loaded during the library load phase.</p>

<p>If <code>eager_load_libraries</code> is <code>true</code> or not specified, Chef Client loads the top level of files in alphabetical order, as before.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>When a user wants to create a more complex library cookbook with multiple Ruby files, they have an issue right now: the library is automatically loaded in alphabetical order, making it hard to organize files.  You can circumvent it somewhat using <code>require_relative</code> to load the other files out of order, but that may load a file twice, leading to other problems.  This RFC circumvents that by requiring files to be loaded explicitly by the user or library writer using <code>require</code>, but allowing for an entry point (<code>default.rb</code>).</p>

<p>There is also the fact that you don&#39;t necessarily <em>need</em> all the functionality in a library cookbook, and this RFC lets you pick and choose what to load.</p>
