<h1>Chef Server API Versioning</h1>

<p>The purpose of this RFC is to specify the means by which Chef Server will support a range of
API versions in a given release.</p>

<p>Each server API version indicates the behavior of the server API as a whole,
at the given version level. For comparison, consider the way a git commit SHA
is representative of the state of the entire repository as of that commit.</p>

<p>Supporting a range of API versions (minimum and maximum) in any given release will allow
API behavior to change, while providing reasonable deprecation expectations for the older behaviors.
This also allows the Server to remain focused on supporting a finite range of behaviors, rather than
needing to support old behaviors indefinitely.</p>

<p>Any given release of the Chef Server will include documentation of the current minimum
and maximum supported API versions, as well as behavior changes between any newly
introduced version and the one prior to it. It will also include, if appropriate,
which version has been deprecated, and which version has been retired.</p>

<p>An important note: API Versioning is determined independently of product versioning.
Product support lifecycle will determine which range of API versions are supported in
a given product release.</p>

<p>Arbitrary examples with no significance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chef Server 12.0 - API Versions 0-3</li>
<li>Chef Server 12.1 - API Versions 0-4</li>
<li>Chef Server 13.0 - API Versions 3-15.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if you are using Chef Server 12.1, any supported client will behave
as it did with Chef Server 12.0, though API v4 will be available to those clients who can use it.<br>
However when you upgrade Chef Server 13.0 you will need to upgrade the client to one that supports
the behaviors introduced or changes in API Version 1 and 2 at minimum.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a consumer of the Chef Server API,
I want to be able to consume significant changes at my own pace
so that they don&#39;t break my usage of the API.

As a user of chef-client at a supported version level,
I want to ensure that changes to the server API don&#39;t affect me until I&#39;m ready to upgrade
so that all my nodes continue to converge even as Chef Server API continues to mature.

As a developer of the Chef Server API,
I want to be able to add potentially breaking features without breaking customers on supported versions
so that the state of the Server API can continue to advance.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The Chef Server API Version (Version from this point forward) is indicated as a whole number,
starting at zero. Zero indicates the behavior of the API at the time of this RFC&#39;s acceptance.</p>

<p>If a client does not indicate a version preference, it will be assumed to request API version zero.
Once zero is not supported, clients must request a specific API version, or the server will not process
the request and return a 406.</p>

<p>If a particular endpoint does not implement versioning due to remaining unchanged, it MUST
behave in a forward-compatible way through the range of currently supported version. In
documentation these will be specified as having compatibility with versions X+ where X is the first
version in which the API was introduced (or zero if existing).</p>

<p>If a particular endpoint does implement versioning and remains unchanged, it MUST behave in a
forward-compatible way through the range of currently supported versions. In documentation
these will be specified as N+, where N is the version at which it was last modified.</p>

<p>For this section, &quot;API&quot; refers to any combination of a method and endpoint, eg <code>GET /users</code>,
<code>POST /organizations/$org/clients</code>, et al.</p>

<h3>Versioning is Global</h3>

<p>No restrictions or requirements are placed on the number of APIs that can be changed in a given API Version.
There is no guarantee of a 1:1 relationship between API changes and server versions. For example,
Server API Version 1 may change the <code>GET /nodes</code> endpoint behavior, while Version 2 may change the behaviors of <code>GET /roles</code>,
<code>PUT /users/:name/keys</code> and <code>DELETE /users/:name</code></p>

<p>Changes grouped into a single version are not guaranteed to be related, except that the
changes were created near the same points in time.</p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>

<p>As an example scenario, we&#39;ll assume a case where the field <code>username</code> is being replaced with <code>name</code> in the body
response in the <code>users</code> endpoint. For this case, we&#39;ll state that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum Server API Version is 10</li>
<li>Maximum Server API Version if 14</li>
<li>This change in behavior to the users endpoint is introducing Server API Version 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>For demonstration, the example request is <code>GET /users/bob</code> with...</p>

<ul>
<li>... X-Ops-Server-API-Version not specified by client

<ul>
<li><code>{ &quot;username&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, ... }</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>... <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 10</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{ &quot;username&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, ... }</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>... <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 14</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{ &quot;username&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, ... }</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>... <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 15</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, ... }</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To continue the example, let&#39;s say we&#39;ve moved forward a year and are now shipping Chef Server 13. At that time we
announce that our new supported API Range is 12-20, and the API Versions 12-14 are considered deprecated.</p>

<p>See <code>Response</code> below for full understanding of the <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> response header content.
For now, just note that <code>request_version</code> is <code>&quot;-1&quot;</code> when an invalid API version was sent (non-integer) and
and response<em>version is <code>&quot;-1&quot;</code> when the `request</em>version` is not supported, indicating that the request was not
responded to.</p>

<p>The GET request from the examples above would generate the following responses:</p>

<ul>
<li>... X-Ops-Server-API-Version not specified by client
<code>
HTTP 406
X-Ops-Server-API-Version: {&quot;min_version&quot;:&quot;12&quot;,&quot;max_version&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;request_version&quot;:&quot;0&quot;, &quot;response_version&quot;:&quot;-1&quot;},
{ &quot;username&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, ... }

<p>Moving forward another year and we have released Chef Server 14.  We announce that API Versions 12-14 are retired

&quot;min_api_version&quot; : 15,
&quot;max_api_version&quot;: 22 }
</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Request</h3>

<p>A client MAY request version compatibility via custom header as follows:</p>

<p><code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: $version</code></p>

<p><code>$version</code> MUST be one of the desired version number, indicated by a whole integer.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>If a client does include this header and <code>$version</code> is...</p>

<ul>
<li>... less than the minimum Version supported by the server product, the
server MUST respond with an HTTP 406 with <code>application/json</code> body specified below.</li>
<li>... greater than the current maximum Version supported,
the server MUST respond with an HTTP 406 and an <code>application/json</code> body specified below.

<ul>
<li>... of a value other than a valid version, the server MUST respond with an HTTP 406
and the body specified below.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Response Header</h4>

<p>In the response header, <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> will return json of the format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{
  &quot;min_version&quot;:&quot;&lt;non-negative integer&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;max_version&quot;:&quot;&lt;non-negative integer&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;request_version&quot;:&quot;&lt;integer&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;response_version&quot;:&quot;&lt;integer&gt;&quot;
}
</pre></div>
<p>Where:
+ <code>min_version</code> is the minimum API version the server supports.
+ <code>max_version</code> is the maximum API version the server supports.
+ <code>request_version</code> is an integer representing the desired API version from the client passed via X-Ops-Server-API-Version
defaulting to 0 if X-Ops-Server-API-Version was not sent by the client. If X-Ops-Server-API-Version sent by the client contained
an invalid value (not an integer), then -1 is returned in <code>request_version</code>.
+ <code>response_version</code> is an integer representing the API version used by the server to process the request.
It either matches what the client requested in X-Ops-Server-API-Version or is -1 if a 406 occurred (which happens
when X-Ops-Server-API-Version sent by the client was invalid or not in the supported range of the server).</p>

<p><code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> is needed to implement client-side support for the multiple versioned API
and to distinguish between servers that have implemented this RFC and servers that do not support multiple versioning.</p>

<p>The <code>Vary</code> header is included in the event it becomes desirable to support caching of specific responses.</p>

<h4>406 Response Body</h4>

<p>When the server provides a 406 response due to unsupported API version, the response body
will be of type <code>application/json</code> and MUST look as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{ &quot;error&quot;           : &quot;invalid-x-ops-server-api-version&quot;,
  &quot;message&quot;         : &quot;Specified version $version not supported&quot;,
  &quot;min_api_version&quot; : $x,
  &quot;max_api_version&quot; : $y }
</pre></div>
<p><code>$version</code> indicates the requested version. <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code> are the current minimum and
maximum supported versions, respectively.</p>

<h3>Server Implementation</h3>

<p>Minimum and maximum version are set in code, and MUST NOT be configurable.</p>

<p>Minimum and maximum values in effect MUST be logged at server startup.  Further, current API support levels
MUST be exposed through a new endpoint, <code>GET /server_api_version</code> as specified below.</p>

<p>The server MUST resolve and validate the version at the start of each request, and retain it in request state
for resources to make use of.</p>

<p>The implementation MAY require addition of version support callbacks in erchef webmachine resources.</p>

<p>Given no <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> header or a <code>null</code> value of version, it MUST resolve to the
minimum supported version.</p>

<p>Given a value of version, it MUST be resolved as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A numeric version MUST be validated against current minimum and maximum versions as
specified under section &quot;Response&quot;.</li>
<li>Any other value is invalid and the server MUST respond to the client with a 406
and the associated response body specified above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Effects on Unmodified APIs:</h3>

<p>APIs that are not modified are not required to support Version.  They are assumed to be
compatible and unchanged through the current range of min/max supported versions.</p>

<h3>Effects on Modified APIs:</h3>

<p>Any API modified as follows MUST use <code>api_version</code> to determine which behavior to
present to the client:</p>

<ul>
<li>new required field on input</li>
<li>change in type of an output field</li>
<li>change in client-facing behavior of the API</li>
</ul>

<p>Any API modified as follows MAY use <code>api_version</code> to determine which behavior to
present to the client:</p>

<ul>
<li>removal of a required input field</li>
<li>addition of an output field</li>
<li>change in internal behavior of the API</li>
</ul>

<h4>New API Implementations</h4>

<p>Any new API MAY implement checking of <code>api_version</code> to determine its availability.</p>

<h4>Deprecated API Behaviors</h4>

<p>Any API behavior that is to be deprecated MUST have the version for both its deprecation and
its removal documented in release notes and in API documentation.</p>

<p>After deprecated behavior has been removed, last supported API version MUST be updated in
accordance with the published documentation.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>When an API is modified in a way that requires support of Version, release notes and API
documentation MUST reflect this.  API documentation MUST further specify minimum/maximum
versions for each endpoint that implements support of versioning.</p>

<h3>New Endpoint: /server_api_version</h3>

<p>This is a new server endpoint that MUST be implemented, and  which supports only the <code>GET</code> method.
Any other method MUST respond with a 405.</p>

<p>The <code>GET</code> response body MUST look as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{ &quot;min_api_version&quot; : $x,
  &quot;max_api_version&quot; : $y }
</pre></div>
<p><code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code> refer to the current minimum and maximum supported versions, respectively.</p>

<h3>New Endpoint: /server_api_version/extended</h3>

<p>This is a new server endpoint that MAY be implemented, and which supports only the <code>GET</code> method.
Any other method MUST respond with a 405.</p>

<p>If this endpoint is implemented, the <code>GET</code> response body contains supported API version data
for each endpoint that has implemented versioning, and MUST look as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{ &quot;endpoints&quot; : [ { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;$relative_url&quot;,
                    &quot;versions&quot; :
                      [ { &quot;method&quot; : $method,
                          &quot;version&quot; : $version
                          &quot;status&quot; : $status }, ... ] } ] }
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>$relative_url</code> is a URL relative to the server root and will not include server name
or protocol, as this value is not intended for direct use by a client in a request.</li>
<li>components in the <code>$relative_url</code> prefixed with <code>:</code> indicate that this is a named value that must be</li>
<li>Multiple version elements for the same method can be returned, made unique by the <code>version</code> field.
provided by the client.</li>
<li><code>$method</code> indicates the http method associated with the endpoint</li>
<li><code>$version</code> indicates the API version to which this information applies, or <code>&quot;next&quot;</code> if this is an
experimental feature or feature under active development.</li>
<li><code>$status</code> indicates current status of this endpoint as either:

<ul>
<li><code>deprecated</code> - this version of the endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in a future revision</li>
<li><code>active</code> - this version of the endpoint is currently active and available for use</li>
<li><code>unstable</code> - this is under active development and the behaviors defined for it are subject to change.
used with <code>version</code> : <code>next</code>, but it is possible to have <code>version</code> : <code>next</code> in conjunction with
<code>status</code> : <code>active</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Sample output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{ &quot;endpoints&quot; : [ { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;/organizations/:orgname/clients/:client&quot;,
                    &quot;versions&quot; :
                      [ { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 0, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;deprecated&quot; },
                        { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 1, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;active&quot;},
                        { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : &quot;next&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;unstable&quot; }] },
                  { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;/users/:user&quot;,
                    &quot;versions&quot; :
                      [ { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 0, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;deprecated&quot;},
                        { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 1, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;active&quot; } ] }
                 ] }
</pre></div>
<p>This endpoint MAY be extended to include information about endpoints that do not
explicitly implement versioning.  The response MUST be in the same form.</p>

<p>The server MAY rate-limit this endpoint due to the potential cost associated with it.</p>

<p>Finally, the server MAY further extend this API to allow clients to query version information for
a specific method + endpoint, in which case version information for that specific endpoint is returned,
or 404 if there is no such endpoint.</p>

<p>To continue the example above, the request:</p>

<p><code>GET /server_api_version/extended/GET/organizations/:orgname/clients/:client</code></p>

<p>Would receive the response:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;/organizations/:orgname/clients/:client&quot;,
   &quot;versions&quot; : [ { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 0, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;deprecated&quot; },
                  { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : 1, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;active&quot; },
                  { &quot;method&quot; : &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;version&quot; : &quot;next&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;unstable&quot;}] },
</pre></div>
<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>As the capabilities of the Chef Server API expand, it becomes necessary
to deprecate and de-support old API behaviors.  However, consumers of the
API such as chef-client may not yet be able to support changed API behaviors.
The version indicator is used by a client to indicate which level of
API behavior it can support.</p>

<p>We have decided on the use of a single custom header to indicate version (instead of url-based or
<code>Accept</code> header-based) for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our REST model requires a specific URL to refer to a specific resource.  This resource is not
versioned, though the semantics of what the resource includes or how to create it may be
versioned.</li>
<li>The URIs currently used by Chef Server are not typically shareable for access via a simple http request
outside of a given context due to authentication and authorization requirements, and so this is not
a consideration in any of the above cases.</li>
<li>Our internal tooling will not always be compatible with URL-based versioning,
as it is not uncommon for a component to assemble its own URIs instead of
relying on the &quot;uri&quot; field returned from the server.</li>
<li>There exists precedent in that we already require specific headers to be
sent from the client in order to service a request. For example, <code>X-Ops-User-Id</code>.</li>
<li>A custom <code>Accept</code> header was also considered, we chose the custom <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> header
to keep our API usage patterns consistent and relatively simple.  As mentioned above
we already require custom headers, and combining those with specific <code>Accept</code> header strings
would mean introducing a new and slightly varied means of obtaining the desired behavior out of the API.</li>
</ul>
