<h1>Enable gem dependencies in cookbook metadata</h1>

<p>Support a &#39;gem&#39; DSL method for cookbook metadata to create a dependency on a rubygem.  The
gem will be installed via <code>chef_gem</code> after all the cookbooks are synchronized but before any
other cookbook loading is done.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Chef User,
I want to be able to use additional gems in libraries, attributes and resources,
to avoid complex workarounds and double-run converges.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Allow users to specify additional gem dependencies like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;poise&quot;</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;chef-sugar&quot;</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;chef-provisioning&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the <code>Chef::RunContext::CookbookCompiler#compile</code> method a phase will be added before <code>compile_libraries</code> which will install all of the gem declarations from all of the synchronized cookbooks before any other cookbook code is compiled.</p>

<p>The implementation will use an in-memory bundler Gemfile which is constructed against all gem statements in all cookbooks which are in the <code>run_list</code>, solved
at the same time.  The syntax of the &#39;gem&#39; statement will support the bundler gem syntax, with the qualification that since it is compiled into metadata.json
that arbitrary ruby code will be expanded at cookbook upload time.</p>

<p>The resulting gemset bundle will be installed into the LIBPATH of the running chef-client.  This may either be directly into the base ruby libraries (per current <code>chef_gem</code> behavior) or into a custom location with the LIBPATH of the chef-client extended to use that location--as an open implementation question.</p>

<p>The normal Gemfile <code>requires</code> tag may be used by users to autoload files out of gems.</p>
