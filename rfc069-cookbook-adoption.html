<h1>Cookbook Adoption On Supermarket</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h3>When a Cookbook is Up For Adoption</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    As a supermarket user,
    When I find a cookbook,
    And the cookbook is up for adoption,
    And the cookbook has been up for adoption for at least 6 months,
    Then the Supermarket team should be notified,
    And ownership of the cookbook should transferred to sous-chefs
</pre></div>
<h3>When a Cookbook is NOT Up for Adoption</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    As a supermarket user,
    When I believe a cookbook should be transferred away from the current owner,
    Only in extreme cases (i.e. death of the current owner),
    I should open an [RFC](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc)
    And request that the cookbook ownership be transferred
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>When a Cookbook is Up For Adoption</h3>

<p>When a cookbook owner puts the cookbook up for adoption, that means they no
longer wish to be the owner and maintainer of the cookbook. At anytime a user
can click on the &quot;Adopt Me!&quot; button on the cookbook&#39;s page on Supermarket and
the current owner of the cookbook will be notified. The owner can then transfer
ownership to the user who wants it.</p>

<p>However, sometimes cookbooks remain up for adoption for 6+ months.  In this
case, the cookbook ownership will be transferred the sous-chefs.  This will
be done manually at first but may be automated in the future.</p>

<p>The sous-chefs will then take over responsibility for the cookbook.  At their
discretion, they can transfer ownership to someone else on Supermarket at any time.</p>

<h3>When a Cookbook is NOT Up For Adoption</h3>

<p>It is not the normal policy of Chef to transfer ownership of a cookbook to anyone
else, that is left to the cookbook&#39;s current owner.  See above for guidelines on
when a cookbook has been placed up for adoption.</p>

<p>We do recognize, however, that extreme circumstances do happen (i.e. death of the
cookbook&#39;s current owner).  In this case a community member who wishes to take
ownership of the cookbook (or see ownership transferred to someone else with their
consent) is welcome to file an <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc">RFC</a>.</p>

<p>The RFCs will be decided on by the Chef Community on a case by case basis.</p>
