<h1>Tracking for Standards Track RFCs</h1>

<p>Standards Track RFCs are intended for implementation.  This proposal aims to
make it easier to tell when an RFC is implemented or withdrawn, or what its
implementation status is.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Chef Contributor,
I want to know whether an RFC is actually being worked on,
so that I can decide whether to wait, write it myself, or write a replacement RFC.

As a Chef Contributor,
I want to know whether an RFC has become withdrawn,
So that I can decide whether to find a new owner for the subject.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Tracking Metadata Field</h3>

<p>RFCs will now include a metadata field called Tracking, which will be a list of URLs to github issues on the relevant repositories where the feature is tracked.</p>

<p>For example, metadata might look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">RFC</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">XXX</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Author</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Daniel DeLeo &lt;dan@getchef.com&gt;</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Status</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Final</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Type</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Standards Track</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Chef-Version</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">12.0</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Tracking</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/12345</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</pre></div>
<p>ALL accepted Standards Track RFCs will have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status of Accepted or Final</li>
<li>Tracking URLs containing at a minimum a Github issue (unless it is an old RFC with Final status, in which case
Tracking URLs are optional)</li>
<li>Chef-Version (if Final)</li>
</ul>

<h3>RFC &quot;Withdrawn&quot; status</h3>

<p>When the author of an RFC is no longer willing to work on it and
no one has stepped up to do it--the RFC is updated to reflect that fact with the
Withdrawn status as documented in RFC-00.  If someone else wants to step back up, they will need to
re-present the RFC and have it Accepted again.</p>

<h3>RFC Acceptance Process Modification</h3>

<p>When a Standards Track RFC is accepted, we will do all the normal things we do,
<em>plus</em> file a github issue for implementation (or link to the existing issue or PR),
and mark the Tracking field with that URL.</p>

<h3>Finalization</h3>

<p>When the implementation issue is resolved as fixed, we mark the RFC Final (or add
other issues tracking the remaining work) and mark the Chef-Version in which it
was shipped.  Issue URLs remain on the RFCs for historical purposes.</p>

<h3>Existing RFCs</h3>

<p>All existing Accepted Standards Track RFCs will either be marked Final or have
Tracking attached to them.  The implementer of a specific RFC is responsible for submitting a PR to mark it as final.
They may optionally be marked Withdrawn if they are no longer going to be worked on.</p>

<p>RFC editors are authorized to accept Pull Requests to change the status of an RFC from &quot;Accepted&quot; to &quot;Final&quot; without the need for explicit approval from the project lead.</p>
